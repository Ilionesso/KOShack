"KOShack" = ultimate KOS hacking tool

"KOShack" refers to the russian word "Кошак" that means a glorious and huge (probably fat, but in a good sence) cat. As Garfield for example.


Using:
1. There are some sensitive dependencies, so you can construct and activate conda environment by environment.yml:

```console
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate koshack
```
If you don't have conda, install it. It's useful.
Otherwise there are dependencies in environment.yml, make the environment in any desired way.

2. Define your kos username, subject codes and checking frequency in KOShack.py
3. Run KOShack.py
4. Submit your password. It should be hidden if you don't use semidebugging pycharm console or whatever.
5. Pray for the everything best.
